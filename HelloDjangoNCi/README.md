# How we write a test cases in django

#### 1. Create a new file in the app directory called tests.py

#### 2. Create a new class that inherits from django.test.TestCase

#### 3. Create a test method that will test the functionality of a specific part of the code

#### 4. Use the assert methods to test the functionality

#### 5. Run the test using the command python manage.py test

#### 6. If the test fails, go back to the code and fix the bug

#### 7. Run the test again

#### 8. If the test passes, write another test for the next part of the code

#### 9. Repeat the process until all the code is tested

#### 10. Celebrate! You have successfully tested your code

#### 11. If you find a bug, write a test for it and then fix the bug
